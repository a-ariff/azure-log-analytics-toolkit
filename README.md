## üîç Overview

A curated collection of Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries for Azure Log Analytics, designed to help security analysts and operations teams monitor their Azure environments effectively. This toolkit focuses on practical, tested queries that address common monitoring and investigation scenarios.

## ‚ú® What's Included

- **16 Curated KQL Queries** - Carefully selected and tested queries for common monitoring scenarios
- **Security Monitoring** - Authentication failures, security events, and threat detection queries
- **Operational Intelligence** - Performance monitoring, resource utilization, and system health checks
- **Documentation** - Clear explanations and use cases for each query
- **Best Practices** - Guidelines for effective log analysis and monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Appropriate RBAC permissions (Log Analytics Reader or higher)
- Basic knowledge of KQL (Kusto Query Language)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-ariff/azure-log-analytics-toolkit.git
   cd azure-log-analytics-toolkit
   ```

2. **Browse the queries**
   Navigate to the queries/ directory and explore the categorized KQL queries.

3. **Run your first query**
   Copy any query from the collection and paste it into your Azure Log Analytics workspace.

### Example Query - Failed Authentication Events

```kql
// Get failed authentication events in the last 24 hours
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where EventID == 4625  // Failed logon
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by Account, Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedAttempts > 5
| order by FailedAttempts desc
```

## üéØ Query Categories

### Key Architecture Components

#### Multi-Subscription Monitoring
- **Centralized Log Analytics Workspace**: A single workspace collecting logs from multiple Azure subscriptions
- **Cross-subscription data collection**: Agents and diagnostic settings configured across different subscription boundaries
- **Unified security monitoring**: Consolidated view of security events and threats across the entire enterprise
- **Scalable resource management**: Distributed resource monitoring with centralized analysis and reporting

#### Centralized Management
- **Single pane of glass**: Unified dashboard for monitoring all enterprise resources
- **Centralized alerting**: Consistent alert rules and notification policies across all subscriptions
- **Role-based access control**: Granular permissions management for different teams and stakeholders
- **Cost optimization**: Centralized log retention policies and data management strategies

#### Integration Capabilities
- **Azure Sentinel integration**: Advanced security analytics and SIEM capabilities
- **Azure Monitor integration**: Comprehensive metrics and logging across all Azure services
- **Third-party SIEM connectivity**: Export capabilities for existing security tools
- **API and PowerShell automation**: Programmatic access for custom integrations and workflows
- **Hybrid connectivity**: On-premises and multi-cloud monitoring through Azure Arc and agents

This enterprise architecture enables organizations to achieve comprehensive visibility, maintain security compliance, and optimize operational efficiency across their entire Azure ecosystem.
